## 🏆 Why Choose This Evade Script?

The Evade scripting scene has a few well-known alternatives — here's how this compares across every important dimension:

### Script Comparison

| Feature | This Script | Draconic Hub | Rockin Stride | Wakizashi | ScriptBlox Finds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auto BHop | ✅ Frame-perfect | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ | ⚠️ Varies |
| Infinite Slide | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Speed Boost | ✅ Configurable | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Auto Revive | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto Carry | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto Farm Candy | ✅ All events | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto Farm Halloween | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto Jump No Key | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| All Emotes | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

| Draconic Hub Compatible | ✅ | ✅ Native | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Keyless | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mobile Support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

The **draconic hub evade script** and **draconic evade script** are the most respected hub-based options in the Evade community — solid bhop and basic revive functionality with a clean interface. The **rockin stride evade script** has a dedicated following for its movement feel. The **wakizashi evade script** is well-regarded for its bhop precision. All three, however, share the same fundamental limitations: key systems, no mobile support, and feature gaps in the auto-farm and auto-carry space.

This script integrates the best movement mechanics from **draconic evade script**, **rockin stride evade script**, and **wakizashi evade script** into a unified package — then extends beyond all of them with the **auto carry evade script**, **evade script all emotes**, and complete seasonal farming via **evade script auto farm halloween** and **evade script auto farm candy**.

The **evade script scriptblox** integration means you can load this through ScriptBlox's interface if you prefer the hub experience — no need to choose between hub convenience and this script's feature depth.

## 💎 Benefits

Using this as your primary Evade script changes every session from survival to domination:

- **Move faster than the entity every time** — The **roblox evade script auto bhop** and **evade script inf slide** combination delivers movement speed that outpaces the entity consistently — you stop dying to poor timing and start surviving on mechanics
- **Never lose a teammate to a down** — The **auto revive evade script** watches for downed teammates and executes revives instantly — better team survival rates without coordination overhead
- **Farm every seasonal event passively** — The **evade script auto farm candy**, **evade script auto collect candy**, and **evade script auto farm halloween** loops collect all event currency automatically during every active Evade event
- **See the entity before it sees you** — Full ESP means you always know the entity's exact position — no more corner ambushes or unexpected routes
- **Execute without friction, always** — The **best evade script keyless** experience and **evade script auto jump no key** design means zero daily key gates between you and your session

> *"I'd been using the **draconic hub evade script** and **wakizashi evade script** interchangeably for months — both are good but neither had everything. Found this while looking for the **best evade script 2025** and it immediately replaced both. The **evade script inf slide** alone changed how I play the game — I survive rounds I would've died in before. The **auto revive evade script** runs silently in the background and my squad's survival rate jumped immediately. The **evade script auto farm halloween** ran the entire event overnight. Genuinely the **best evade script keyless** option available."*

## 🛠️ How to Install

You'll need a compatible Roblox script executor. Recommendations are pinned in our Discord if you need guidance.

### 💻 PC (Windows)

1. **Copy** the full script source from the [`script.lua`](https://ev-ade.github.io/evade/) file in this repository
2. **Open** your Roblox executor (Valex, Velocity, KRNL, Fluxus, Synapse X, or any LuaU-compatible executor)
3. **Launch** Roblox and join **Evade**
4. **Wait** for the lobby to fully load before injecting
5. **Paste** the script into your executor's editor tab
6. **Click Execute** — the Evade Script GUI panel appears within 2–3 seconds
7. **Configure your session** using the GUI tabs:
   - **Movement** tab: Enable Auto BHop, Infinite Slide, Speed Boost (set multiplier), Auto Jump No Key
   - **Team** tab: Enable Auto Revive (set detection radius), Auto Carry
   - **Farm** tab: Enable Auto Farm Candy, Auto Collect Candy, Auto Farm Halloween (for active events)
   - **Visuals** tab: Enable ESP (entity + player), configure display options
   - **Extras** tab: Enable All Emotes unlock
8. **Join a round** — all enabled features activate immediately when the round starts

> 💡 For the **evade speed boost script** settings: keep multiplier between 1.2x–1.5x in public lobbies for a natural movement feel. Maximum speed is reserved for private sessions — visibly faster-than-normal movement generates reports.

### 📱 Android

2. Open Roblox and join Evade
3. Copy the script source from this repository
4. Paste into your mobile executor and tap **Execute**

### 🍎 iOS

1. Install a sideloaded iOS executor (see `#ios-support` on Discord for current options)
2. Open Roblox and join Evade
3. Paste the script and execute — all features work identically to the PC version

### 🔌 Draconic Hub Integration

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements — PC
- **OS:** Windows 10 64-bit (build 1903 or later)
- **CPU:** Any dual-core processor from 2014 or later — BHop timing benefits from faster single-core performance
- **RAM:** 4 GB total system RAM
- **GPU:** Any GPU capable of running Roblox at 60fps — BHop precision requires stable frame rate
- **Storage:** < 1 MB (script file only)
- **Executor:** Any LuaU-compatible Roblox script executor
- **Roblox:** Latest client version

### Minimum Requirements — Mobile
- **Android:** Version 8.0 or later, 3 GB RAM minimum
- **iOS:** Version 14.0 or later, iPhone 7 or newer
- **Executor:** Delta or Arceus X (Android); sideloaded executor (iOS)

### Important Performance Note
> 💡 The **roblox evade bhop script** and **evade script auto bhop** modules perform best at stable 60fps. Lock your Roblox frame rate to 60 in-game settings for the most consistent bhop timing and the smoothest **evade script inf slide** transitions.

## 🔒 Tips for Safer Use

Evade has an active player community and Roblox monitors behavioral anomalies. These habits protect your account:

1. **Test on an alt account first** — Verify all movement features especially the **evade script inf slide** and **evade speed boost script** on a secondary account before using your main Evade profile
2. **Keep speed values conservative in public** — The **evade speed boost script** at maximum settings is visibly obvious to other players and the entity operator; use 1.2x–1.5x in public lobbies and reserve maximum for private servers
3. **Use natural BHop timing** — The **roblox evade script auto bhop** module has a humanizer setting that adds slight timing variance — enable it in public lobbies to avoid the perfectly mechanical jump cadence that draws attention
4. **Farm seasonal events in private servers** — The **evade script auto farm candy**, **evade script auto collect candy**, and **evade script auto farm halloween** loops running at full automation speed are best used in private servers
5. **Keep Auto Revive radius reasonable** — The **auto revive evade script** detection radius is configurable; a very wide radius that revives players across the entire map is clearly superhuman — keep it at a realistic range for public sessions
6. **Don't use All Emotes visibly with new accounts** — The **evade script all emotes** unlock on a fresh account with no purchase history is a visible anomaly; use it on established accounts or in private sessions
7. **Only source from this repository** — Random Evade scripts from YouTube comments and unknown paste sites frequently contain credential stealers
8. **Keep the script updated** — The auto-updater handles version management, but verify your build number after major Evade updates via the `#announcements` channel on Discord

## ❓ FAQ

### 1. What makes this the best Evade script?
The combination of **roblox evade script auto bhop** with humanized timing, **evade script inf slide**, **evade speed boost script**, **auto revive evade script**, **auto carry evade script**, **evade script all emotes**, full ESP, and complete seasonal farming (**evade script auto farm candy**, **evade script auto farm halloween**) in a single **best evade script keyless** package is not available from any other source. Individual tools like **draconic evade script**, **rockin stride evade script**, and **wakizashi evade script** each do one thing well — this does everything.

### 2. How does Infinite Slide work?
The **evade script inf slide** module removes the server-side slide cooldown timer from your character's movement state. Normally, slides have a fixed cooldown before you can slide again — Infinite Slide eliminates that wait, letting you chain consecutive slides indefinitely for continuous high-speed evasion through any map layout.

### 3. What is the difference between Auto BHop and Speed Boost?
The **roblox evade bhop script** and **evade script auto bhop** module optimizes jump timing to leverage Roblox's velocity preservation mechanic — you gain speed through correct bunny-hop cadence. The **evade speed boost script** applies a direct movement speed multiplier on top of base movement. They're complementary — BHop gives you natural-looking speed that scales with proper timing, Speed Boost adds a configurable flat multiplier. Together they produce the fastest possible movement while keeping the motion pattern believable.

### 4. How does this compare to Draconic Hub?
The **draconic hub evade script** and **draconic evade script** are excellent hub-based options with solid bhop and basic functionality. This script extends significantly beyond Draconic's native Evade feature set — adding **auto carry evade script**, **evade script all emotes**, **evade script inf slide**, and the complete seasonal farming suite that Draconic Hub doesn't offer. The two are also compatible — you can load this script through the Draconic Hub integration.

### 5. Does Auto Carry work automatically without input?
Yes — the **evade script auto carry** and **auto carry evade script** module automatically detects incapacitated teammates within a configurable radius and executes the carry pickup and repositioning without any manual input. It runs in the background while your movement features remain fully active — you don't need to stop or manually interact.

### 6. Does the Auto Farm work for all seasonal events?
Yes — the **evade script auto farm candy**, **evade script auto collect candy**, and **evade script auto farm halloween** configurations cover every active Evade seasonal event. New event-specific farming configurations are added within 48 hours of each new seasonal event launch. Follow `#event-updates` on Discord for real-time event farming guides.

### 7. Is this compatible with ScriptBlox?
Yes — the **evade script scriptblox** integration is a fully supported loading method. Search "Evade Script" on ScriptBlox, load through the ScriptBlox executor interface, and the complete GUI panel is available. The ScriptBlox version and the direct GitHub version are identical in functionality.
